# Contacts app

This is the in-class project for Udacity's Nanodegree React course.
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

## Project Overview

The Contacts app project is a front-end project. However, we'll eventually be storing the contacts on a backend server downloaded from [Udacity course's starter server repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server).


## Installation

- Download or clone the repository
```
  git clone https://github.com/ShaggyT/react-contacts
```

- Install and start the API server

  - The server is built in Node. The repo for the project is at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server.

  ```
    cd backend
    npm install
    node server
  ```

- Install and start the Contact front-end application
```
  cd frontend
  npm install
  npm start
```

## API Server

Information about the API server and how to use it can be found in its [README file](backend/README.md).
