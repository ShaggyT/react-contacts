## Project Overview

The Contacts app project is a front-end project. However, we'll eventually be storing the contacts on a backend server downloaded from [Udacity course's starter server repository](https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server).
 
## Installation

  1. Download or clone the repository
  ```
    - git clone https://github.com/ShaggyT/react-contacts
  ```
  2. Install and start the API server
   - The server is built in Node. The repo for the project is at https://github.com/udacity/reactnd-contacts-server.
  ```
    - cd backend
    - npm install
    - node server
  ```

   3. Install and start the Contact front-end application
  
    ```
      cd frontend
